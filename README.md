# JS-Memory_Game
 ## Rules  

Turn two cards, if you guessed **CORRECTLY** they will stay turned, and you get to PLAY AGAIN.

**IF NOT** they will flip back and the turn goes to the OTHER PLAYER.

Your moves to solve this memory will be counted and stored.

So you can challenge yourself into beating your freinds and the highscore with less moves!
